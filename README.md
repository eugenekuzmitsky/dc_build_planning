Planning homelab/dc build in plain text

TaskJuggler v3 is being used to create the simple plan in plain text file. 
TaskJuggler then compiles the plan and produces report(s) if instructed inside plan file.

I use simple Gantt chart generation to html file. Please note that report was generated 1/23/2025 - and red vertical line on the Gantt chart shows this day as a current.
